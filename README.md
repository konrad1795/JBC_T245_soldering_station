# JBC_T245_soldering_station
This repository shows a controller for the JBC T245 handle. In contrast to other designs, this design is powered by DC and has an earthed tip nonetheless.

The cartridge pinout is taken from the reverse-engineered schematic of the JBC CD-2BC station (thanks to johnmx!):
